    <div class="center">
        <h1>Fugitive</h1>
        <p>The cunning fugitive moves between hideouts to catch a plane. Can the agent track down the fugitive before they escape, or being outmaneuvered?</p>
        
        <h3>Game Setup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shuffle the ‚ô£Ô∏èClubs, ‚ô•Ô∏èHearts, and ‚ô†Ô∏èSpades separately into 3 draw piles.</li>
            <li>Place the ‚ô¶Ô∏è10 face-up on one side of the table as the starting card.</li>
            <li>The fugitive starts with ‚ô¶Ô∏èJ/Q/K and one Joker in their hand.</li>
            <li>Remove all other Diamonds and another Joker from the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Card Ranking</h3>
        <p>‚ô¶Ô∏è10-K < ‚ô£Ô∏èA-K < ‚ô•Ô∏èA-K < ‚ô†Ô∏èA-K < üÉè</p>
        <p>The fugitive must play a higher card than previous one, but no more than 3 ranks higher (i.e., runs at most 3 steps at a time). In order to win, the fugitive must place down the Joker.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <ul>
                <li>‚ô£Ô∏èA is 3 ranks higher than ‚ô¶Ô∏èJ, making it a valid play.</li>
                <li>The Joker is 1 rank higher than ‚ô†Ô∏èK.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <h3> The first round</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fugitive's Turn</b>: Draws 3 cards from Clubs and 2 from Hearts, then plays 1 or 2 cards face-down as <i>hideouts</i>.</li>
            <li><b>Agent's Turn</b>: Draws 2 cards from any pile and makes one guess about the fugitive‚Äôs hideouts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> The later rounds</h3>
        <p>Players take turns, starting by drawing 1 card from any pile:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Fugitive</b> plays 1 or 0 hideout, with an option to sprint.</li>
                <li><b>The Agent</b> makes one guess of the hideouts.</li>
            </ul>
    

        <h3>Sprint Move</h3>
        <p>The fugitive may discard one or more cards to move extra distance:</p>
        <ul class="dash-list">
            <li>Discarding an <i>odd-numbered card</i> increases the maximum step limit by 1.</li>
            <li>Discarding an <i>even-numbered card</i> increases the maximum step limit by 2.</li>
            <li>Discarded cards are placed face-down under the hideout played in this turn.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Guessing Hideouts</h3>
        <p>The agent guess whether a specific card is among the face-down hideouts. If correct, the fugitive reveal the card along with any discarded cards below. The agent may guess multiple cards at once, but must hit all to count as correct.</p>
        

        <h3>Winning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The agent wins</b> if they reveal all of the fugitive‚Äôs hideouts before the Joker is played (face-up).</li>
            <li><b>The fugitive wins</b> if they play the Joker AND at least one Spade hideout has been revealed.</li>
            <li><b>The agent gets one last chance</b> if no Spade hideout has been revealed:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The agent guesses one card at a time.</li>
                <li>If the guess is correct, they continue.</li>
                <li>If it is wrong, the fugitive wins and escapes.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
