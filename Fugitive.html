        <h1>Fugitive</h1>
        <p>The cunning fugitive moves between hideouts to catch a plane. Can the agent track down the fugitive before they escape, or being outmaneuvered?</p>
        
        <h2>Game Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Shuffle the ‚ô£Ô∏èClubs, ‚ô•Ô∏èHearts, and ‚ô†Ô∏èSpades separately into 3 draw piles.</li>
            <li>Place the ‚ô¶Ô∏è10 face-up on one side of the table as the starting card.</li>
            <li>The fugitive starts with ‚ô¶Ô∏èJ/Q/K and one Joker in their hand.</li>
            <li>Remove all other Diamonds and another Joker from the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Card Ranking</h3>
        <p>‚ô¶Ô∏è10-K < ‚ô£Ô∏èA-K < ‚ô•Ô∏èA-K < ‚ô†Ô∏èA-K < üÉè</p>
        <p>The fugitive must play a higher card than previous one, but no more than 3 ranks higher (i.e., runs at most 3 steps at a time). In order to win, the fugitive must place down the Joker.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <ul>
                <li>‚ô£Ô∏èA is 3 ranks higher than ‚ô¶Ô∏èJ, making it a valid play.</li>
                <li>The Joker is 1 rank higher than ‚ô†Ô∏èK.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <h3> The first round:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fugitive's Turn</b>: Draws 3 cards from Clubs and 2 from Hearts, then plays 1 or 2 cards face-down as <i>hideouts</i>.</li>
            <li><b>Agent's Turn</b>: Draws 2 cards from any pile and makes one guess about the fugitive‚Äôs hideouts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> The later rounds:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Players take turns, starting by drawing 1 card from any pile.</li>
            <li>The fugitive plays 1 or 0 hideout, with an option to sprint.</li>
            <li>The agent continues making guess.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Sprint Move</h3>
        <p>The fugitive may discard one or more cards to move extra distance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discarding an <i>odd-numbered card</i> increases the maximum step limit by 1.</li>
            <li>Discarding an <i>even-numbered card</i> increases the maximum step limit by 2.</li>
            <li>Discarded cards are placed face-down under the hideout played in this turn.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Guessing Hideouts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The agent guess whether a specific card is among the face-down hideouts.</li>
            <li>If correct, the fugitive reveal the card along with any discarded cards below.</li>
            <li>The agent may guess multiple cards at once, but must guess all correctly to count as a success.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Winning Conditions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The agent wins</b> if they reveal all of the fugitive‚Äôs hideouts before the Joker is played (face-up).</li>
            <li><b>The fugitive wins</b> if they play the Joker AND at least one Spade hideout has been revealed.</li>
            <li><b>The agent gets one last chance</b> if no Spade hideout has been revealed:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The agent guesses one card at a time.</li>
                <li>If the guess is correct, they continue.</li>
                <li>If it is wrong, the fugitive wins and escapes.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
