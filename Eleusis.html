        <h1>Eleusis</h1>
        <p>The classical card game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis_(card_game)">Eleusis</a> redesigned to be cooperative, no more frustration.</p>
        <p>One player, the "God", secretly decides a card-playing rule. Other players must deduce this rule through testing or questioning. Recommended for 2-5 players.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>&nbsp Examples of Possible Rules:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Only cards with prime numbers are accepted.</li>
                <li>No more than two cards can have the same number.</li>
                <li>The number of black cards on the table must exceed the red.</li>
                <li>A red card must always be followed by an even-numbered card.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Use a standard deck of cards without jokers. <br>
            Players take turns drawing two cards and choosing one of two actions:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Testing the Rule:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hand both cards to the <i>God</i>.</li>
            <li>The <i>God</i> reveals whether one of them follows the rule.</li>
            <li>If accepted, place it below the last accepted card.</li>
            <li>The other card is discarded.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Asking a Question or Guessing the Rule:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Discard both cards.</li>
            <li>Either make a guess or ask the <i>God</i> a question.</li>
            <li>The <i>God</i> may only answer "Yes" or "No".</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If the deck runs out before the rule is guessed, everyone loses. <br>If players successfully deduce the rule, everyone wins.</p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Default Settings:</strong> A-K represent 1-13. Only red/black matters (not suits). Rejected or discarded cards are not considered in rule validation.</li>
            <li><strong>Initial Rule Conditions:</strong> If a rule involves a comparison (e.g., "each card must be larger than the previous one"), then the first card is always accepted.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>&nbsp Common Questions to Ask</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Is the rule only concerned about the previous one/two cards?</li>
                <li>Does the rule concern the color or parity (odd/even) of the cards?</li>
                <li>Does the rule involve mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)?</li>
            </ul>
