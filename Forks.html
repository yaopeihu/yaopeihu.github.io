        <h1>Forks</h1>
        <p>Three players compete in the capital market. Use 2–10 from four suits. 
        Each suit represents an asset class. The number represents its investment popularity.</p>
        
        <p>Adapted from <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/404233/forks-2nd-edition">Forks</a> by Mark Stockton-Pitt.</p>

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Deal 12 cards to each player as their draw deck. </li>
            <li>Each round, players draw 3 cards from their deck. </li>
            <li>Simultaneously, each player pass 2 cards to the left.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Rounds 1–3</b>: Players take turns to play 1 card face-up from the cards received from the right. The staring player rotates each round.</p>
        <p><b>Rounds 4</b>: Players simultaneously play 1 card face-down and reveal it together.</p>
        
        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stack played cards by suit. At the end of 4 rounds, rank the suits by total face value. Ties break as ♠ > ♥ > ♣ > ♦. </li>
            <li>Each player earns or loses based on the value of cards in their hand. The top 2 suits yield positive returns, no gain for the 3rd and negative for the lowest.</li>
        </ul>
