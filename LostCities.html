        <h1>Lost Cities</h1>
        <p>
            We are about to seek treasure in a lost city, but every expedition comes at a steep price. 
            You can also enlist local companions, which doubles both the risk and the reward in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
            This version is adapted from the original by Reiner Knizia and can be played with a standard deck of playing cards.
        </p>

        <h2>Game Setup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a standard deck of playing cards and remove <strong>4 Aces</strong>, placing them in the center of the table to represent the four lost cities.</li>
            <li>Deal <strong>1 Joker</strong> to each player. Shuffle the remaining cards to form a draw pile.</li>
            <li>Each player starts by drawing <strong>5 cards</strong>, so together with the Joker, everyone has <strong>6 cards</strong> in hand at the start.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>Game Play</h2>
        <p>Players take turns. On your turn, play one card then draw one card.</p>
        <p>
            When playing a card, it must match the suit of one of the Aces:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Play it <em>on your side</em> of the Ace to signify exploring that city, or</li>
            <li>Place it <em>on top of the Ace</em> (i.e., on the city’s discard pile) to discard that card.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            When drawing a card, you may:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Draw the <em>top card from the draw pile</em>, or</li>
            <li>Take the <em>top card from any city’s discard pile</em>.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>As soon as the draw pile is empty, the round ends.</p>
    
        <hr>
    
        <h2>Exploring with Cards</h2>
        <p>
            Each player’s exploration is independent; you only consider the cards on your side for scoring.
        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>2–10 (Number Cards):</strong>  
                Except for the first card you play in that city, each subsequent number card must be strictly higher than the previous number card used in that city.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Joker (Wild Card):</strong>  
                <ul>
                    <li>May substitute for any suit’s number card.</li>
                    <li>Can only be played immediately after a <strong>2–9</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Its “value” is considered the previous card’s value <strong>+1</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>J, Q, K (Multiplier Cards):</strong>  
                <ul>
                    <li>Must be played <strong>before</strong> any number cards are placed for that city.</li>
                    <li>Playing 1/2/3 of these multiplier cards makes the final score for that city multiply by <strong>2/3/4</strong> respectively.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <hr>
    
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>
            For each city you explored, calculate:<br>
            <em>(Sum of Number Cards – Cost) × Multiplier</em><br>
            The <strong>cost</strong> is <strong>20</strong>. Sum all city scores you have (for each city you explored) to get your total exploration score.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is recommended to play <strong>three rounds</strong>. The player with the highest total score across all rounds wins.
