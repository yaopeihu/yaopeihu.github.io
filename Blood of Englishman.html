        <h1>The Blood of an Englishman</h1>

        <p>An asymmetric duel for 2 players. Jack is nimble, darting through the castles and climbing beanstalks in search of treasure. The Giant responds with deliberation and crushing power, invoking ancient spells to trap the intruder.</p>

            <li>Move it to the front of any castle column (if taken from the back, it can only be placed at the front of the same column)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each beanstalk must consist of 6 Beanstalk Cards in ascending order. Once completed, Jack must place a Treasure Card on it before starting a new one.</p>

            <li>Remove any one Beanstalk Card from the castles (out of the game)</li>
            <li>Do two moves: each move is transferring the front card of a castle to the front of another castle</li>
        </ul>
