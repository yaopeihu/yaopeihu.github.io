        <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p>Use a standard deck with 7s, 8s, 9s, 10s, and Jokers removed. Shuffle the remaining 36 cards. Arrange them in a pyramid structure, alternating face-up and face-down per row.</p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Take turns to pick up 2 cards, except for the first player's initial turn (only 1 card).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A card can only be taken when fully uncovered.</li>
                <li>If a face-down card is exposed, flip it immediately.</li>
                <li>All picked cards must be placed publicly for both players to see.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Victory Conditions</h2>
        <ul class="dash-list">
            <li>Have 3 more face cards than the opponent.</li>
            <li>Collect four of a kind (excluding J/Q/K).</li>
            <li>Form a straight flush (A-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6).</li>
        </ul>
