    <h1>Coda</h1>
    <p> A mini deduction game for 2-4 players with just half a deck of cards, inspired by the classic board game <em>Coda</em> (also known as <em>Da Vinci Code</em>). 
       This article introduces a self-designed gameplay mode with a dynamic balancing mechanism. 
    </p>

    <h2>Game Setup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Take all Hearts and Spades cards numbered 2 to K from a standard deck (24 cards in total). Shuffle these cards thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Deal 4 starting cards to each player (in a 4-player game, deal 3 cards each). The remaining cards form the draw pile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Card Arrangement</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All cards are placed face-down initially, but players can check their own cards at any time.</li>
        <li>Players must arrange their cards in ascending order (low to high) in front of them.</li>
        <li>Cards with the same value can be placed in any relative order.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Players take turns in a clockwise order. On their turn, each player performs the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Draw a Card:</strong> Draw one card from the pile and add it to your lineup, keeping it face-down and following the arrangement rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Guess an Opponent's Card:</strong> Attempt to guess if an opponent's hidden cards include a specific value.
            <ul>
                <li>If the guess is correct, the opponent must reveal one matching card of their choice. You may then continue guessing or end your turn.</li>
                <li>If the guess is incorrect, you must reveal the card you just added to your lineup, and your turn ends.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Game End</h2>
    <p>
        When the draw pile is empty, players can only guess cards during their turn. If a guess is incorrect, the turn immediately passes to the next player.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game ends when there is only one player left with unrevealed (secret) cards. That player is the winner.
