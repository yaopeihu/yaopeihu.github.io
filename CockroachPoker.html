        <h1>Cockroach Poker</h1>
        <p>When you spot one cockroach at home, it means more are on their way.<//p>
        <p>This is an adaptation of the original <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11971/cockroach-poker">game</a> using a 52-deck of playing card.</p>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 players (recommended): deal a hand of 13 cards each.</li>
            <li>5 players: 10 cards each (discard the extra 2 cards face up).</li>
            <li>3 players: 15 cards each (discard the extra 7 cards face down).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>The starting player plays a card face down and pushes it to any other player while declaring its suit or rank. For example:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>‚ÄúThis card is an 8.‚Äù</li>
            <li>‚ÄúThis card is a heart.‚Äù</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>The receiver can choose to judge or peek</strong>.
        
        <p>üëâ If the receiver chooses to <strong>judge</strong>, they must say whether they believe the claim or not. Then the card is revealed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If their judgment is incorrect, they must keep the card in front of them.</li>
            <li>If correct, the card is returned to the original player.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>üëâ If the receiver chooses to <strong>peek</strong>, they must pass the card to another player who has not yet received it this round. They must also make a claim about the card in the same category (suit or rank).</p>

        <p>If the card reaches the final player in the round, they must make a judgment. The player who concedes to take the card becomes the new starting player.</p>

        <h3>Winning Conditions</h3>
        <p>The game ends when any player meets one of the following conditions. The player with the fewest cards in front of them wins:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They accumulate <strong>three cards of the same rank</strong>.</li>
            <li>They accumulate <strong>four cards of the same suit</strong>.</li>
            <li>It is their turn to play, but they have no cards left in hand.</li>
        </ul>
